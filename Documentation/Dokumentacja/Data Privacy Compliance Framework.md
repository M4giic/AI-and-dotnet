## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the data privacy compliance framework for the Event Management Platform. The framework ensures alignment with global privacy regulations while supporting the platform's core functionality of event management, registration processing, and attendee engagement.

## 2. Data Classification Model

The platform implements a four-tier data classification system:

```
┌────────────────┐
│ Restricted     │ PII, payment data, credentials
├────────────────┤
│ Confidential   │ Registration details, contact info
├────────────────┤
│ Internal       │ Event configurations, analytics
├────────────────┤
│ Public         │ Published event information
└────────────────┘
```

Each classification tier has defined protection requirements, retention periods, and access controls. Data classification is embedded in the database schema with mandatory classification metadata for all data objects.

## 3. Privacy Architecture

### 3.1 Privacy by Design Implementation

The platform embeds privacy controls into core architecture:

![Privacy Architecture](https://claude.ai/chat/72f5462a-f7dc-4259-a037-894d9ed99795)

Key architectural components include:

- Data minimization at collection points
- Encryption services for sensitive fields
- Consent management framework
- Rights fulfillment automation
- Audit logging for compliance verification

## 4. Regulatory Compliance Matrix

The platform implements controls mapped to specific regulatory requirements:

|Regulatory Requirement|Implementation Approach|Responsible Team|
|---|---|---|
|Lawful Basis (GDPR Art. 6)|Consent tracking, contract documentation|Legal|
|Right to Access|Self-service portal, API endpoints|Engineering|
|Right to Delete|Deletion workflow with validation|Data Ops|
|Data Portability|Structured export formats|Engineering|
|Breach Notification|Incident response workflow|Security|
|Children's Data Protection|Age verification, guardian consent|Legal|
|Cross-Border Transfers|Geographic data routing, SCCs|Compliance|

## 5. Consent Management

The platform employs a granular consent model:

```
                  +----------------+
                  | Consent Record |
                  +----------------+
                         ▲
         ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
  +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+
  | Marketing     | | Analytics     | | Third-Party   |
  | Communications| | Processing    | | Sharing       |
  +---------------+ +---------------+ +---------------+
         ▲                 ▲                 ▲
      ┌──┴──┐          ┌──┴──┐          ┌──┴──┐
  ┌───┴───┐ │      ┌───┴───┐ │      ┌───┴───┐ │
  │ Email │ │      │ Usage │ │      │ Partners │
  └───────┘ │      └───────┘ │      └───────┘ │
  ┌───────┐ │      ┌───────┐ │      ┌───────┐ │
  │ SMS   │ │      │ Profile│ │      │ Vendors│
  └───────┘ │      └───────┘ │      └───────┘ │
  ┌───────┐ │                │                │
  │ Postal│ │                │                │
  └───────┘ │                │                │
            ▼                ▼                ▼
      Fine-grained consent options with version tracking
```

Consent records include timestamp, source, scope, expiration, and version information. The system enforces respect for consent choices throughout the processing lifecycle.

## 6. Data Subject Rights Fulfillment

Automated workflows process privacy rights requests:

1. **Authentication** - Verify requestor identity through multi-factor verification
2. **Validation** - Confirm request scope and legitimacy
3. **Processing** - Execute appropriate data operations based on request type
4. **Documentation** - Record request details and response for compliance records

Average fulfillment timeframes:

- Access requests: 3 business days
- Deletion requests: 7 business days
- Portability requests: 5 business days
- Objection requests: 2 business days

## 7. International Data Transfers

The platform implements region-specific data handling:

![Data Flow Diagram](https://claude.ai/chat/72f5462a-f7dc-4259-a037-894d9ed99795)

Implementation includes:

- Regional data storage with geo-fencing
- Standard Contractual Clauses for cross-border transfers
- Privacy Shield alternatives for US transfers
- Data residency options for jurisdiction-specific requirements

## 8. Vendor Management

Third-party processors undergo privacy assessment:

1. Questionnaire-based evaluation of privacy practices
2. Contract terms with explicit data protection obligations
3. Regular compliance verification through audit or certification
4. Documented sub-processor management and approval

Risk-based approach prioritizes scrutiny based on data sensitivity, processing volume, and access level.

## 9. Compliance Documentation

The platform maintains comprehensive compliance records:

- Data inventory with processing purposes and legal basis
- Data Protection Impact Assessments for high-risk processing
- Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) documentation
- Privacy notices with version history
- Training records for personnel
- Processor agreements and due diligence documentation

## 10. Continuous Improvement

Privacy compliance undergoes regular enhancement:

- Quarterly regulatory monitoring for legislative changes
- Annual comprehensive privacy review
- Compliance metrics with trend analysis
- Regular testing of privacy controls
- Privacy enhancement roadmap with prioritized improvements
