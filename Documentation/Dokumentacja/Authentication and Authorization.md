# Event Management Platform - Authentication and Authorization

## Overview

The Event Management Platform implements a comprehensive authentication and authorization system to secure the application and ensure that users can only access the resources and perform actions they are authorized for.

## Authentication Strategy

### Identity Framework

The application uses ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication:

- User account management
- Password hashing and validation
- Account lockout
- Two-factor authentication support
- External login providers
- Email confirmation

### JWT Authentication

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for stateless authentication:

- Token generation upon successful login
- Token validation for secured API endpoints
- Claims-based identity
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Secure token storage

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials (username/password)
2. Server validates credentials against Identity database
3. If valid, server generates JWT with appropriate claims
4. JWT is returned to client and stored securely
5. Subsequent requests include JWT in Authorization header
6. Server validates JWT and extracts identity for authorization

## Authorization Strategy

### Role-Based Authorization

Users are assigned to one or more roles that determine their permissions:

1. **Administrator**
    
    - Full system access
    - User management capabilities
    - System configuration
    - Report generation
2. **Organizer**
    
    - Create and manage events
    - Manage registrations for their events
    - Access event analytics
    - Manage speakers for their events
3. **Speaker**
    
    - View events where they are speaking
    - Manage their speaker profile
    - Upload session materials
    - View session attendees
4. **Attendee**
    
    - Browse and register for events
    - Manage personal registrations
    - View event and session details
    - Provide feedback

### Policy-Based Authorization

Custom authorization policies for complex requirements:

- Event ownership policy
- Registration management policy
- Content modification policy
- Payment processing policy
- Reporting access policy

### Resource-Based Authorization

Authorization checks based on resource ownership:

- Event organizers can only modify their own events
- Users can only view and modify their own registrations
- Speakers can only upload materials for their sessions

## User Flows

### Registration Process

1. User visits registration page

4. Confirmation email is sent
5. User confirms email
6. User can now log in

### Login Process

1. User visits login page
2. User provides credentials
3. System validates credentials
4. If valid, JWT is generated and provided
5. User is redirected to appropriate landing page
6. Authentication state is maintained across session

### Password Reset

1. User requests password reset
2. System generates secure token
3. Reset link is sent to user's email
4. User clicks link and enters new password
5. System validates and updates password
6. User can log in with new password

### Role Assignment

1. Administrator accesses user management

3. Administrator assigns or removes roles
4. System updates user's claims
5. User's permissions are immediately updated
6. Audit log records the change
