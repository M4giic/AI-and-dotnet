## 1. Introduction

This Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) outlines the procedures, responsibilities, and resources required to recover the Event Management Platform in the event of a disaster or major service disruption. The plan aims to minimize downtime, data loss, and business impact by providing a clear framework for response and recovery activities.

The Event Management Platform supports critical business functions for event organizers and attendees. Extended outages could lead to significant business disruption, including canceled events, lost registrations, and damage to reputation. This plan addresses various disaster scenarios and provides actionable recovery strategies to maintain business continuity.

## 2. Recovery Objectives

### 2.1 Recovery Time and Point Objectives

The following recovery objectives have been established for the platform:

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The maximum acceptable time to restore system functionality after a disaster.

- Tier 1 (Critical) Components: 4 hours
- Tier 2 (Important) Components: 12 hours
- Tier 3 (Non-Critical) Components: 24 hours

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable data loss measured in time.

- Production Database: 15 minutes
- File Storage: 1 hour
- Log Data: 6 hours

These objectives guide our backup strategies, infrastructure design, and recovery procedures. They represent a balance between recovery costs and business continuity requirements.

### 2.2 System Prioritization

System recovery follows a prioritized approach based on business impact:

**Tier 1 (Critical) Components:**

- Authentication and authorization services
- Core database services
- Event viewing and registration functionality
- Payment processing system

**Tier 2 (Important) Components:**

- Email notification system
- Reporting and analytics
- Content management functionality
- Administrative interfaces

**Tier 3 (Non-Critical) Components:**

- Historical reporting data
- Non-essential integrations
- Development and testing environments

This prioritization ensures that recovery efforts focus first on the components most essential to business operations.

## 3. Disaster Scenarios

### 3.1 Infrastructure Failures

The plan addresses various infrastructure-related disasters:

**Data Center Outage:** Complete loss of the primary data center due to power failure, network issues, or physical damage. Recovery involves activating standby infrastructure in alternate locations and redirecting traffic.

**Cloud Provider Disruption:** Major outage affecting our cloud service provider's region or services. Recovery involves activating multi-region failover capabilities and utilizing redundant services from alternative providers where possible.

**Network Failure:** Loss of connectivity between system components or with external users. Recovery includes activating redundant network paths, switching to alternate providers, and updating DNS or routing as needed.

### 3.2 Data-Related Disasters

Data integrity and availability challenges include:

**Data Corruption:** Database or file system corruption affecting data integrity. Recovery involves restoring from the most recent verified backup, followed by transaction log replay where applicable.

**Ransomware Attack:** Encryption of system data by malicious actors. Recovery includes isolating affected systems, restoring from clean backups, and implementing security measures before reconnection.

**Accidental Data Deletion:** Unintended deletion of critical data through human error or system malfunction. Recovery utilizes point-in-time restore capabilities and transaction logs to recover the data to the state just before deletion.

### 3.3 Application Failures

Application-level disasters include:

**Failed Deployment:** A system update that introduces critical bugs or incompatibilities. Recovery involves rolling back to the previous known-good version using automated deployment tools.

**Third-Party Integration Failure:** Breakdown of essential external service integrations. Recovery includes activating fallback mechanisms, implementing graceful degradation, and establishing direct communication with vendor support teams.

**Performance Collapse:** System overload leading to cascading failures. Recovery focuses on identifying and addressing bottlenecks, scaling key resources, and implementing throttling mechanisms.

## 4. Recovery Strategies

### 4.1 Data Backup Strategy

Comprehensive data protection includes:

**Database Backups:** Full backups every 24 hours, differential backups every 6 hours, and transaction log backups every 15 minutes. Backups are stored both locally and in geographically separate locations with appropriate encryption.

**File Storage Backups:** Incremental backups every hour with daily consolidation. Critical files like event images and documents use cross-region replication for real-time redundancy.

**Configuration Backups:** Infrastructure-as-code templates, application configurations, and environment settings are version-controlled and backed up daily. These are essential for quick reconstruction of environments.

**Backup Validation:** Regular automated restore testing verifies backup integrity and recovery procedures. Monthly tests include full database restores to validate recoverability.

### 4.2 High Availability Architecture

The system employs multiple redundancy mechanisms:

**Multi-Region Deployment:** Critical components are deployed across multiple geographic regions, allowing for region-level failover without data loss. Active-active configuration maintains service availability even if an entire region fails.

**Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple application instances, automatically routing around failed nodes. Health checks continuously verify instance availability and remove problematic servers from rotation.

**Database Redundancy:** Primary-secondary replication with automated failover provides database resilience. Read replicas distribute query load and provide immediate recovery options.

**Stateless Application Design:** Application servers maintain no critical state, allowing any instance to handle any request. This enables rapid scaling and simplifies recovery after instance failures.

### 4.3 Failover Procedures

Automated and manual failover processes include:

**Database Failover:** Automated promotion of secondary database to primary role upon detection of primary failure. This process typically completes within minutes with minimal data loss, depending on replication lag.

**Application Failover:** Load balancers automatically direct traffic away from failed application instances. Auto-scaling groups replace failed instances with new ones based on predefined templates.

**Regional Failover:** If an entire region becomes unavailable, DNS updates redirect users to alternate regions. This may involve some brief service interruption during the transition period.

**Third-Party Service Failover:** For critical external dependencies, the system maintains alternate providers or degraded operation modes that can be activated when primary services fail.

## 5. Recovery Procedures

### 5.1 Disaster Declaration and Response

The disaster response process follows these steps:

**1. Incident Detection:** Monitoring systems alert the on-call engineer to potential disasters based on predefined thresholds and failure patterns. User reports and operational anomalies may also trigger investigation.

**2. Assessment:** The on-call engineer performs initial assessment to determine the nature and scope of the incident, consulting with subject matter experts as needed.

**3. Disaster Declaration:** If the incident meets disaster criteria (projected to exceed RTO or significant data loss), a disaster is formally declared, activating this plan.

**4. Team Mobilization:** The recovery team is assembled according to the type and severity of the disaster. Team members are notified through redundant communication channels.

**5. Initial Response:** Immediate actions to contain the disaster and prevent further damage, such as isolating affected systems or activating failover mechanisms.

### 5.2 Recovery Execution

The recovery process varies by scenario but generally follows this pattern:

**1. Environment Preparation:** Provision or prepare recovery environments based on infrastructure-as-code templates and configuration backups.

**2. Data Restoration:** Restore the most recent verified backups for affected data stores, applying transaction logs where possible to minimize data loss.

**3. Application Deployment:** Deploy application components in priority order (Tier 1, then Tier 2, then Tier 3) using automated deployment pipelines.

**4. Integration Verification:** Test connections between system components and with essential third-party services to ensure proper functioning.

**5. Functionality Validation:** Execute test cases for critical business functions to verify system integrity and correctness.

**6. Public Restoration:** Gradually redirect user traffic to the recovered system, monitoring for issues and scaling resources as needed.

### 5.3 Post-Recovery Activities

After service restoration, these activities ensure stability and improvement:

**1. Monitoring Period:** Enhanced monitoring for 24-48 hours after recovery to quickly identify any issues that emerge.

**2. Data Reconciliation:** Verify data integrity and reconcile any transactions that occurred during the recovery window.

**3. Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct thorough investigation to identify the ultimate cause of the disaster and prevent recurrence.

**4. Plan Improvement:** Update the disaster recovery plan based on lessons learned during the actual recovery process.

**5. Stakeholder Communication:** Provide detailed post-mortem information to internal teams and appropriate summaries to affected customers.

## 6. Communication Plan

### 6.1 Internal Communication

Team communication during disaster recovery:

**Communication Channels:** Primary channel is the incident management system, with backup channels including group messaging, conference bridges, and email. All channels have documented alternatives in case primary methods are unavailable.

**Status Updates:** Regular updates at predefined intervals (typically hourly for severe incidents) keep all team members informed of recovery progress, challenges, and priorities.

**Escalation Paths:** Clear guidance on when and how to escalate issues to senior management, specialized teams, or vendor support. Contact information is maintained in multiple locations accessible during disasters.

### 6.2 External Communication

Customer and stakeholder communication:

**Status Page:** Public-facing status page provides real-time information about system availability and incident progress. This page is hosted on infrastructure separate from the main application.

**Customer Notifications:** Templates for various disaster scenarios allow for quick, accurate communication with affected users. Communication timing and frequency is adjusted based on incident severity and expected resolution time.

**Media Relations:** For significant incidents, designated spokespersons handle media inquiries according to crisis communication guidelines. All other team members refer inquiries to these individuals.

## 7. Team Roles and Responsibilities

### 7.1 Recovery Team Structure

The disaster recovery team includes:

**Incident Commander:** Oversees the entire recovery operation, makes key decisions, and coordinates team activities. The incident commander is the single point of authority during recovery operations.

**Technical Recovery Team:** Engineers responsible for executing recovery procedures, divided into specialized groups for database, application, infrastructure, and networking.

**Communication Coordinator:** Manages internal and external communications, ensuring consistent messaging and appropriate information sharing.

**Business Liaison:** Represents business stakeholders, provides input on priorities, and communicates business impact throughout the recovery process.
