# Event Management Platform - Backend Services

## Overview

The backend of the Event Management Platform is built using ASP.NET Core following a clean architecture pattern with a focus on domain-driven design. Services are organized into a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Service Layer Architecture

The backend services are divided into the following layers:

1. **API Layer**: ASP.NET Core controllers that handle HTTP requests
2. **Application Layer**: Contains application logic, commands, and queries
3. **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and domain entities
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns like database access and external services

## Core Services

### NotificationService

The NotificationService handles system notifications:

- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- In-app notifications
- Notification preferences

Key operations:

- Notification template management
- Scheduled notifications
- Batch notification processing
- Notification delivery status tracking
- Notification preferences per user

## Application Services

### CQRS Implementation

The application layer implements the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern using MediatR:

#### Commands

Commands represent operations that change state:

- CreateEventCommand
- UpdateEventCommand
- PublishEventCommand
- CancelEventCommand
- CreateRegistrationCommand
- ConfirmRegistrationCommand
- CancelRegistrationCommand
- CheckInAttendeeCommand

Each command has a corresponding handler that contains the logic to execute the command.

#### Queries

Queries represent operations that retrieve data:

- GetEventByIdQuery
- GetEventListQuery
- GetUpcomingEventsQuery
- GetRegistrationByIdQuery
- GetUserRegistrationsQuery
- GetEventRegistrationsQuery
- GetSessionsByEventQuery
- GetSpeakersByEventQuery

Each query has a corresponding handler that retrieves and returns the requested data.

### Validation

Input validation is handled using FluentValidation:

- Command validators
- Query validators
- Domain entity validators

### Mapping

Object mapping is handled using AutoMapper:

- Entity to DTO mapping
- DTO to entity mapping
- Mapping profiles per domain area

## Infrastructure Services

### Data Access

Data access is implemented using Entity Framework Core:

- DbContext implementation
- Repository pattern implementation
- Query specifications
- Migrations management
- Seeding data

### External Service Integrations

- Stripe
- PayPal
- Bank transfer processing

#### Email Service Integration

Integration with email providers:

- SendGrid
- SMTP service
- Email template rendering

#### SMS Service Integration

Integration with SMS providers:

- Twilio
- SMS template management

#### Calendar Integration

Integration with calendar services:

- Google Calendar
- Microsoft Outlook
- iCalendar generation

#### File Storage

Integration with file storage services:

- Azure Blob Storage
- Local file system
- File access security

### Caching

Caching implementation:

- Response caching
- Distributed caching with Redis
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Memory caching

### Background Processing

Background job processing:

- Scheduled tasks
- Long-running operations
- Notification dispatching
- Report generation
- Data exports

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
