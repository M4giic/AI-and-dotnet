# Event Management Platform - Payment Processing

## Overview

The Payment Processing module handles all financial transactions within the Event Management Platform, including ticket purchases, refunds, and financial reporting. It provides a secure, compliant, and flexible payment infrastructure that supports multiple payment methods and integrates with popular payment gateways.

## Architecture

### Payment Processing Flow

The payment process follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**
    
    - User selects ticket type(s)
    - System calculates total amount
    - Payment intent is created
2. **Payment Method Selection**
    
    - User chooses payment method
    - Required payment details are collected
    - Payment form is validated
3. **Processing**
    
    - Payment request is sent to payment gateway
    - Gateway processes the transaction
    - Result is returned to the platform
4. **Confirmation**
    
    - Successful payments trigger registration confirmation
    - Payment receipt is generated
    - Confirmation is sent to the user
5. **Reconciliation**
    
    - Transaction is recorded in the system
    - Financial records are updated
    - Reports are generated for accounting

## Security Implementation

### PCI DSS Compliance

Measures to ensure PCI compliance:

1. **Tokenization**
    
    - Credit card data never touches our servers
    - Only payment tokens are stored
    - Gateway handles all card data
2. **Data Encryption**
    
    - All financial data is encrypted at rest
    - TLS 1.2+ for all API communication
    - Encryption keys managed via Azure Key Vault
3. **Access Controls**
    
    - Role-based access to financial functions
    - Audit logging for all payment operations
    - Strict permission model for refunds and adjustments
4. **Network Security**
    
    - Payment processing on isolated subnets
    - WAF protection for payment endpoints
    - Regular security scanning

### Fraud Prevention

Measures to prevent and detect fraud:

1. **Transaction Monitoring**
    
    - Velocity checking for rapid purchases
    - Amount threshold validation
    - IP geolocation analysis
    - Device fingerprinting
2. **Verification Processes**
    
    - Address Verification Service (AVS)
    - Card Verification Value (CVV) validation
    - 3D Secure integration
    - Suspicious transaction flagging
3. **Manual Review**
    
    - High-value transaction review process
    - Suspicious activity alerts
    - Admin approval workflows for large transactions

## Webhook Handling

The system processes the following payment gateway webhooks:

### Stripe Webhooks

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/webhooks/stripe")]
public class StripeWebhookController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IPaymentService _paymentService;
    private readonly ILogger<StripeWebhookController> _logger;
    private readonly string _webhookSecret;
    
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> HandleWebhook()
    {
        var json = await new StreamReader(HttpContext.Request.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
        
        try
        {
            var stripeEvent = EventUtility.ConstructEvent(
                json,
                Request.Headers["Stripe-Signature"],
                _webhookSecret
            );
            
            switch (stripeEvent.Type)
            {
                case "payment_intent.succeeded":
                    var paymentIntent = stripeEvent.Data.Object as PaymentIntent;
                    await _paymentService.HandlePaymentSucceeded(paymentIntent.Id);
                    break;
                    
                case "payment_intent.payment_failed":
                    var failedPaymentIntent = stripeEvent.Data.Object as PaymentIntent;
                    await _paymentService.HandlePaymentFailed(
                        failedPaymentIntent.Id, 
                        failedPaymentIntent.LastPaymentError?.Message
                    );
                    break;
                    
                case "charge.refunded":
                    var charge = stripeEvent.Data.Object as Charge;
                    await _paymentService.HandleRefundProcessed(charge.Id);
                    break;
                    
                // Handle other webhook types
                    
                default:
                    _logger.LogInformation($"Unhandled event type: {stripeEvent.Type}");
                    break;
            }
            
            return Ok();
        }
        catch (StripeException e)
        {
            _logger.LogError(e, "Stripe webhook error");
