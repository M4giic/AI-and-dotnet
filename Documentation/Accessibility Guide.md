## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the accessibility standards, practices, and guidelines for the Event Management Platform. Creating an accessible platform ensures that people with disabilities can effectively use our system to organize, manage, and attend events. Accessibility is not only a legal requirement in many jurisdictions but also aligns with our commitment to inclusive design.

The Event Management Platform aims to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at Level AA, ensuring that the platform is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, including those with disabilities. This guide helps developers, designers, content creators, and testers implement and maintain accessibility throughout the platform.

## 2. Accessibility Standards

### 2.1 Compliance Goals

The Event Management Platform adheres to the following accessibility standards:

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA serves as our primary accessibility standard. All user interfaces, both public-facing and administrative, must meet WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria. Beyond WCAG, the platform also considers requirements from relevant regulations such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the European Accessibility Act.

We regularly review and update our accessibility approach to incorporate emerging best practices and evolving standards. The platform undergoes periodic accessibility audits to validate compliance and identify areas for improvement.

### 2.2 Supported Assistive Technologies

The platform is designed to work with common assistive technologies including:

Screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which convert digital text into synthesized speech for users with visual impairments. Keyboard navigation for users who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device. Screen magnification software that enlarges portions of the screen for users with low vision. Voice recognition software for users who cannot use a keyboard or pointing device. Switch devices and alternative input methods for users with motor disabilities.

The platform is tested regularly with these technologies to ensure compatibility and a seamless user experience.

## 3. Design Guidelines

### 3.1 Visual Design

Accessible visual design considers the needs of users with various visual impairments:

Color and contrast requirements include maintaining a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. The platform never relies on color alone to convey information, always providing additional indicators such as text labels, patterns, or icons. A color blindness simulator is used during design review to ensure content remains distinguishable for users with color vision deficiencies.

Typography focuses on readability, using sans-serif fonts at appropriate sizes (minimum 16px for body text). Line heights of at least 1.5 times the font size improve readability for users with reading disabilities. Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality, accommodating users who need larger text.

Layout and spacing considerations include consistent navigation, clear visual hierarchy, and sufficient space between interactive elements (minimum target size of 44x44 pixels). The design is responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes and zoom levels without horizontal scrolling at zoom levels up to 400%.

### 3.2 Interactive Elements

Interactive elements must be accessible to all users, regardless of input method:

Buttons, links, and controls have clear visual indicators of their purpose and state. Focus indicators remain visible and high-contrast, helping keyboard users track their position on the page. Interactive elements have appropriately sized click/tap targets to accommodate users with motor control limitations.

Form elements include visible labels (not just placeholders), clear error messages, and accessible validation. Required fields are identified both visually and programmatically. Form organization follows a logical structure, grouping related fields and providing clear instructions.

Custom interactive components such as date pickers, dropdown menus, and modal dialogs implement appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties to ensure screen reader compatibility. These components are thoroughly tested with keyboard navigation and assistive technologies.

## 4. Development Guidelines

### 4.1 Semantic Structure

Proper HTML semantics create a solid foundation for accessibility:

Document structure uses appropriate heading levels (H1-H6) to create a logical outline of the page content. Landmarks such as header, nav, main, and footer help screen reader users navigate the page efficiently. Lists (ordered, unordered, and definition) are used for presenting related items, while tables are reserved for true tabular data with proper headers and captions.

Meaningful sequence ensures that the reading order matches the visual order of content, which is particularly important for screen reader users. Content flows logically when CSS is disabled, indicating proper document structure. Related items are grouped using appropriate structural elements.

### 4.2 Keyboard Accessibility

Many users rely exclusively on the keyboard for navigation:

Keyboard navigation ensures all functionality is available without requiring a mouse. Users can tab through interactive elements in a logical order, with focus management that maintains context during complex interactions. Custom keyboard shortcuts for common actions include a mechanism to view and modify these shortcuts.

Focus management is especially important in dynamic applications. When content changes or new sections appear, focus moves predictably to maintain user context. Focus trapping within modal dialogs prevents keyboard users from accidentally interacting with content behind the dialog. Focus styles are visible and consistent throughout the application.

### 4.3 ARIA Implementation

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes enhance accessibility when needed:

ARIA roles clarify the purpose of custom elements that don't have semantic HTML equivalents. States and properties communicate the current condition of interactive elements, such as expanded/collapsed, selected/unselected, or busy/idle. Live regions announce dynamic content changes to screen reader users without disrupting their current focus.

The platform follows the first rule of ARIA: "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA." Native HTML elements are used whenever possible, with ARIA serving as an enhancement rather than a replacement for proper semantic HTML. All ARIA implementations are thoroughly tested with actual assistive technologies.

## 5. Content Guidelines

### 5.1 Text Alternatives

Non-text content requires alternatives for users who cannot perceive the original:

Images have appropriate alt text that conveys their purpose or content. Decorative images use empty alt attributes to indicate they should be ignored by screen readers. Complex images such as charts or diagrams include detailed descriptions either in the alt text or in adjacent content.

Multimedia content such as videos includes captions for deaf or hard-of-hearing users and audio descriptions for blind users. Audio-only content provides transcripts. Controls for media players are fully accessible via keyboard and properly labeled for screen readers.

Data visualizations like charts and graphs include text alternatives explaining the key information and trends. Where possible, data is also available in alternative formats such as data tables, allowing users to access the information in their preferred way.

### 5.2 Language and Readability

Clear, understandable content benefits all users, especially those with cognitive disabilities:

Plain language principles include using common words, active voice, and concise sentences. Complex terminology is explained or defined when necessary for the context. Instructions are clear and straightforward, avoiding ambiguous directions or unnecessary jargon.

Page titles and headings accurately describe the content they introduce, helping users understand the page structure and locate specific information. Link text clearly indicates the destination or action, avoiding generic phrases like "click here" or "read more."

Content organization follows a logical, predictable pattern throughout the platform. Related information is grouped together, and important information appears before secondary details. Consistent formatting and terminology help users learn and navigate the platform efficiently.

## 6. Testing and Validation

### 6.1 Testing Methods

Comprehensive accessibility testing includes several complementary approaches:

Automated testing tools scan for basic accessibility issues such as missing alt text, contrast problems, and improper heading structure. These tools provide a first line of defense but cannot identify all accessibility issues, particularly those related to usability or context.

Manual testing by developers and QA specialists involves keyboard navigation testing, screen reader testing, and validation against WCAG checklists. This deeper testing identifies issues that automated tools might miss, such as improper focus management or misleading screen reader announcements.

User testing with people who have disabilities provides the most valuable feedback. Participants who use various assistive technologies perform real-world tasks on the platform, revealing practical accessibility issues that may not be apparent through other testing methods.

### 6.2 Validation Process

Accessibility validation occurs throughout the development process:

Design review includes accessibility considerations from the beginning, evaluating wireframes and mockups for potential issues before development begins. Component testing validates the accessibility of individual UI components before they are integrated into larger features.

Feature testing examines the accessibility of complete user journeys, ensuring that components work together accessibly in context. Regression testing verifies that accessibility fixes remain effective and that new changes don't introduce accessibility regressions.

Regular audits by third-party accessibility specialists provide an objective assessment of platform accessibility. These comprehensive reviews help identify systemic issues and prioritize improvements for future development.

## 7. Feedback and Continuous Improvement

### 7.1 User Feedback

User feedback is essential for identifying and addressing accessibility issues:

Accessibility feedback channels make it easy for users to report problems they encounter. These channels include an accessibility-specific contact form, support email, and in-application feedback mechanism. All reported accessibility issues are tracked and prioritized for resolution.

User research specifically includes participants with disabilities to ensure their perspectives inform platform development. Feedback sessions, surveys, and usability testing with diverse users help identify both problems and opportunities for improvement.

### 7.2 Improvement Process

Accessibility improvement follows a structured process:

Issue tracking categorizes and prioritizes accessibility issues based on impact, affected user groups, and complexity. High-impact issues that create barriers for users receive immediate attention, while less critical issues are incorporated into the regular development cycle.

Knowledge sharing ensures that lessons learned from accessibility work are distributed throughout the organization. This includes internal training sessions, documentation updates, and the creation of accessible component libraries that can be reused across the platform.

Continuous learning keeps the team updated on evolving accessibility standards, technologies, and best practices. Team members participate in accessibility conferences, webinars, and communities of practice to maintain and expand their expertise.

## 8. Conclusion

Accessibility is an ongoing commitment that requires attention throughout the design, development, and maintenance of the Event Management Platform. By following these guidelines and integrating accessibility into our regular workflows, we create a platform that truly serves all users, regardless of their abilities or the technologies they use.

Regular review of accessibility practices, incorporation of user feedback, and monitoring of emerging standards ensure that the platform's accessibility continues to improve over time. This commitment to accessibility not only fulfills legal requirements but also aligns with our core mission of making event management available to everyone.
